# nanogpt-lecture

### Required Dependecies : Python, Pytorch

Code created based on the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT.

This is a GPT that uses a letter level tokenizer, which has very minimal pre-processing involved as compared to actual tokenizers used by companies such as OpenAI.

gpt.py is the file to be run, and will randomly generate some text depending on some given context, which can be typed out in the terminal.
